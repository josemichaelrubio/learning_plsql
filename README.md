## Keep in Mind

* Be aware that I will skip some sections in this course because I already know PL/SQL, this will just brush up on some miss topics.
* I am using a Macbook Pro M1 Pro, PL/SQL does not normally work on macOS but there is a way to make it happpen, here is the path to the .md that will show you how BUT BEWARNED, I don't know its limitations: [docs/macOS_install_with_HR.md](docs/macOS_install_with_HR.md); This file also contains how to set up HR Schema which will be used for the course.
